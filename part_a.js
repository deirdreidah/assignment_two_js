//Number – Can be written with or without decimals.  Example: 2, 1.12 
//String – Is a series of characters. Example: "Welcome" 
//Boolean – Only have two values true and false. 
// Null – Represents an intentional absence of a value. Example: let x = null;
//Undefined – Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
//BigInt – can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number. Example: BigInt(1234567890123456789) 
//Symbol – Used to create unique identifiers. Example: const id = Symbol("id"); 

//2
//null is an intentional absence of a value and must be assigned explicitly.
//undefined means the variable has been declared but not assigned a value

//3
//Primitive Data Types (like Number, String, Boolean) store single immutable values directly in memory.
//Reference Data Types (like Object, Array, Function) store references to their location in memory

//4
//The typeof operator is used to check the data type of a variable.

//5
//Type coercion is when JavaScript automatically converts values between different data types.

//6
//== (loose equality) converts data types before comparing.
//=== (strict equality) compares both value and type.

//7
//Mutable data types can be modified after creation (e.g., objects, arrays).
//Immutable data types cannot be changed (e.g., strings, numbers)
